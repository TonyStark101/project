# project

This is my CS50 final project. I made a Discord Bot Word remover as my final project for CS50. I coded this discord bot using Discord.js in visual studio code. To activate the bot, type "forbid" and then type the word/phrase you do not want in your server. If a server member is to type a word/phrase that is banned in a message, then that message would get deleted and the bot would send a direct message to the member who typed that word/phrase, telling that member to stop typing it.
